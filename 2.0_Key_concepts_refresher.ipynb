    "As we start working with bigger text documents, sets of tokens and numerical representations, the amount of individual bits of information we need to store and refer back to becomes **massive**. We'll learn some new Python concepts to both handle large collections of data, and to process them.\n",

    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task. A number of thesse have been pre-programmed in Python, so to use them and run the code you can simply type the name of the function followed by () - inside which we can put the parameters we want it to use in performing the function. Here are the ones we have looked at already:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `print()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print()` function in Python takes any what ever input you put inside the brackets and prints it out on one line of text on the screen, or other standard output device. It an take strings or other objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `split()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `split()` function in Python can be used to turn a sentence into a list of words\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "text = \"this is my text and it contains words\"\n",
    "print(text.split())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `len()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `len()` function in Python can be used to get the **length of a given string**. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "letters_in_book = len(book_text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Indexing`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also extract **specific characters** from a string, given a **numerical index**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We do this using ``square brackets[]``. \n",
    "\n",
    "In coding, we **start counting at 0**. This means the first letter of a string is as follows \n",
    "\n",
    "``\n",
    "first_letter_in_book = book_text[0]\n",
    "``\n",
    "\n",
    "It also means **last character** will be at index **length - 1**. So we can also combine with the `len()` function to calculate this!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Slicing`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to get **more than 1 character**, we can provide two indexes with a ``colon:`` inbetween to specify a range.\n",
    "\n",

Do we need this as a separate concept from `Uber`, `limo`, `Hackney Carriage` or `car`?. If we take it as one, do we miss out on other combinations like `black cab` or `taxi driver`? What about punctuation?\n",
